    <h3>Basic Share Tasks</h3>
    <br>

    <li><strong>Add group:</strong> Groups are used for sharing tasks, add a group on the sidebar options icon drop.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Inviting users:</strong> Click on the group name with the right mouse, or by holding your finger on the group name on mobile, and click on Manage users, a popup will open up, type in the name of the person you want to share with. If it’s someone you’ve never shared a group with before, you’ll need to type in the email associated with their account. You can then delete the invite or remove the user from the group from this popup.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Accepting invites:</strong> When you have an invite, there will be an icon showing the number of invites right next to the sidebar options icon drop. There you can accept or reject invites, by accepting the invite, you'll automatically be added on the group, and will then be able to add/edit/delete tasks.</li>
