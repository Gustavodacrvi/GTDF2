    <li>After completion, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly tasks.</li>
      <br>

    <li>
      <strong>After completion:</strong> repeat tasks X days after its previous instance completion, if a task isn't checked off, it won't go to Overdue, it'll simply sit there waiting to be checked, then it'll repeat after X days.
    </li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Daily:</strong> the same as periodic and similar to after completion, but, if a task isn't checked off, it goes to overdue, then it'll need to be checked off twice.
